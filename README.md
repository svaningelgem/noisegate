Real-time microphone noise cancellation for Windows. Pure-Rust inference, WASAPI low-latency capture/render, system-tray UI. Pipes cleaned audio into VB-Cable so any app (Zoom, Teams, Discord, OBS, browser calls) sees a noise-free mic.

> Status: pre-alpha scaffold. Builds on Windows 10/11 with the MSVC toolchain. Tested on (none yet — you're the first).

## Why

Existing noise-cancellation tools either cost money (Krisp), require an RTX GPU (NVIDIA Broadcast), or are Linux-only (NoiseTorch). NoiseGate is a free, open-source, lightweight alternative for Windows that runs on any CPU, with a swappable model so you can opt into a state-of-the-art network when you want one.

## Stack

- **Audio I/O:** WASAPI shared low-latency, event-driven, MMCSS Pro Audio scheduling.
- **Routing:** VB-Cable (free virtual audio cable, [vb-audio.com](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)).
- **DSP model:** **RNNoise** by default (via the [`nnnoiseless`](https://github.com/jneem/nnnoiseless) crate — pure-Rust port). Optional **ONNX** path for newer models like DeepFilterNet3 from Hugging Face.
- **UI:** `tray-icon` + `winit` event loop.
- **Lang:** Rust 2021, single static binary, ~10 MB stripped (RNNoise default), ~25 MB with ONNX runtime.

## Architecture

```
physical mic ─► WASAPI capture ─► ring A ─► DSP thread (denoiser) ─► ring B ─► WASAPI render ─► VB-Cable Input
                                                                                                        │
                                                               other apps choose "CABLE Output" as mic ◄┘
```

Three dedicated MMCSS-priority threads. Lock-free SPSC ring buffers (8 frames ≈ 80 ms headroom). 480-sample (10 ms) frames end-to-end — the native frame size for both RNNoise and DeepFilterNet, so no reblocking inside the DSP path.

## Noise suppression model

Two supported backends, both real-time:

| Backend | Default? | Quality | Install size | How |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RNNoise** (via `nnnoiseless`) | ✅ | ★★★ Good. Excellent for stationary noise (fans, hum). Older classical-RNN architecture. | +0 MB (model embedded) | Just `cargo build`. |
| **ONNX (DeepFilterNet3 etc.)** | opt-in (`--features onnx`) | ★★★★★ State of the art. | +15 MB (`onnxruntime.dll`) + ~12 MB model file you supply | Build with `--features onnx`, point config at an ONNX file. See below. |

For most users, RNNoise is what shipping software did until ~2022 and is still good enough for clean voice calls. Step up to ONNX/DFN3 when you have non-stationary noise (kids, traffic, music) and the extra CPU is worth it (typically 3-7%).

## Install

### Option A — Download a prebuilt `.exe` (easiest, once releases are cut)

Grab the latest binary from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Yashsomalkar/noisegate/releases)**, then jump to [Set up audio routing](#set-up-audio-routing) below.

> No releases yet? Build from source (Option B). A GitHub Actions workflow will start producing prebuilt binaries on every tagged release.

### Option B — Build from source

You need three things on your Windows 10/11 machine:

| # | Component | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Rust toolchain** | [rustup-init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) — or visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) | Pick the default (`stable`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). |
| 2 | **MSVC C++ build tools** | [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) | In the installer, check **"Desktop development with C++"** (gives you `link.exe` + the Windows SDK). |
| 3 | **VB-Cable virtual audio driver** | [vb-audio.com/Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) ([direct ZIP](https://download.vb-audio.com/Download_CABLE/VBCABLE_Driver_Pack43.zip)) | Extract, run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` as Administrator, reboot. |
| 4 | **Git** *(probably already installed)* | [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | Used to clone the repo. |

Then in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Yashsomalkar/noisegate.git
cd noisegate
cargo build --release
.\target\release\noisegate.exe
```

First build pulls ~300 MB of crates and takes 5-10 minutes. Subsequent builds are seconds.

A tray icon appears in the system tray (bottom-right corner of your taskbar) — no console window; NoiseGate is a GUI-subsystem binary. Right-click the icon for the menu:

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | Toggles denoising. Unchecked = bypass, audio still flows. **Left-clicking the tray icon** does the same thing, so the common action needs one click. |
| **Microphone ▸** | Pick the input device. **Windows default** is selected out of the box and follows whatever Windows is using. Switching restarts the audio pipeline in place and is remembered. |
| **Start with Windows** | Adds/removes a `NoiseGate` value under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. Per-user, no elevation, and the checkbox reflects the registry rather than the config file. |
| **Open log folder** | Opens `%APPDATA%\NoiseGate\logs`. |
| **Quit NoiseGate** | Exits. |

The icon itself reports state at a glance:

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Blue-green disc | Denoising is **on**. |
| Orange disc | **Bypassed** — audio still flows, unprocessed. |
| ⚠ badge on the corner | **Audio isn't running at all** (no cable, no mic, device failed). |

Hovering shows the active backend, ON/BYPASS, and a CPU meter.

The command-line flags still work when you run it from a terminal — NoiseGate attaches to the calling console (and leaves redirection to a file or pipe alone). If audio can't start, you get a dialog explaining why and the tray stays up, so you can fix the problem and pick a microphone without relaunching.

### Install a virtual audio cable

NoiseGate is a normal user-mode application. Windows lets it *read* a microphone and *write* to an output, but there is no user-mode API to publish a new microphone that other apps can select — that needs a kernel-mode audio driver. So a virtual cable supplies the "microphone" half:

```
real mic ─► NoiseGate ─► CABLE Input  ║  CABLE Output ─► Zoom / Teams / Discord
                                      ╚══ the cable ══╝
```

**VB-Cable** is the usual choice: free ([donationware](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)), properly signed, five minutes to install.

1. Download the driver pack from **<https://vb-audio.com/Cable/>**.
2. Extract the zip anywhere.
3. Right-click **`VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe`** → **Run as administrator**, then click **Install Driver**.
4. Reboot if it asks. The endpoints often appear immediately.

Confirm it worked:

```powershell
.\noisegate.exe --list-devices
```

You should see `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)` under inputs and `CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)` under outputs, the latter tagged `[VB-Cable]`.

> **Two things the installer changes that catch people out.**
>
> It makes the cable the **default device for both playback and recording**. That means your speakers/headphones go silent — system audio is now going into the cable. Open **Sound settings** and set your real output back as default.
>
> It also becomes the default **microphone**, which for NoiseGate specifically means "use the Windows default mic" would capture from the cable we render into — the cable feeding itself. NoiseGate detects that and refuses to start rather than looping; pick your real microphone from the tray menu.

Any cable works, not just VB-Audio's — NoiseGate also recognises VoiceMeeter and Virtual Audio Cable endpoints. For anything else, set `output_device_id` in `config.toml` to its id from `--list-devices`.

Open-source virtual audio drivers exist ([Virtual-Audio-Driver](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Audio-Driver), [AudioMirror](https://github.com/JannesP/AudioMirror), and others) and are perfectly good code, but none ship a production-signed binary — they need Windows test-signing mode enabled, which disables a system-wide security boundary. That's why the recommendation is a signed third-party cable rather than one we bundle. NoiseGate can't ship its own driver either: Microsoft [attestation signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/code-signing-attestation) requires an EV certificate (~$280–580/year) held by a registered company.

### Set up audio routing

Once NoiseGate is running, point your communication apps at VB-Cable instead of your real microphone:

1. Open **Windows Sound Settings** → **Sound** → **Input**.
2. Verify **CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** is in the device list. If not, the VB-Cable install didn't finish — re-run step 3 above.
3. In Zoom / Teams / Discord / OBS / browser settings, choose **CABLE Output** as the microphone.

NoiseGate captures from your real mic, denoises, and writes the cleaned signal into **CABLE Input**. Apps that listen to **CABLE Output** then receive your noise-free voice.

> If NoiseGate can't find the CABLE Input endpoint it **stops with an error** instead of picking another output. That's deliberate: falling back to the default render device would play your microphone out of whatever speakers, headset or meeting-room display happens to be default. Install VB-Cable, or set `output_device_id` explicitly.

> **Sanity test**: open the Windows **Voice Recorder** app, set its mic to **CABLE Output**, record 10 seconds with a fan / typing in the background. Toggle NoiseGate's tray Enable off and re-record. The difference should be obvious.

## Picking a specific microphone

By default NoiseGate captures from your **system default mic**. If that's a Bluetooth headset, Windows will switch the headset into **HFP/Hands-Free mode** as soon as we open the mic — that's a Windows-wide behavior, not a NoiseGate bug, and it sounds awful (16 kHz mono, glitchy). Pick your USB or built-in mic instead.

Easiest way is the tray: right-click the icon → **Microphone** → pick one. The choice is saved and applied immediately. From the command line:

```powershell
# See what's available:
.\noisegate.exe --list-devices

# Run with a specific mic (substring match on the friendly name):
.\noisegate.exe --mic "USB"
.\noisegate.exe --mic "Yeti"
.\noisegate.exe --mic "Realtek"
```

For a permanent choice, copy the device `id` from `--list-devices` into `%APPDATA%\NoiseGate\config.toml`:

```toml
input_device_id = "{0.0.1.00000000}.{...your-id...}"
```

## Configuration

`%APPDATA%\NoiseGate\config.toml` — created on first run:

```toml
input_device = ""            # microphone by name; empty = Windows default
output_device = ""           # by name; empty = auto-detect a virtual cable
enabled = true
attenuation_db = 100.0       # 6.0 = subtle, 100.0 = max. ONNX models only;
                             # RNNoise has no equivalent knob.
auto_start = false           # mirrors the tray checkbox; the registry is
                             # the source of truth
model_path = ""              # ONNX model to use instead of RNNoise
```

Logs at `%APPDATA%\NoiseGate\logs\noisegate.log` (rolled over at 5 MB). Tune verbosity with `RUST_LOG=noisegate=debug`.

## Trying it without VB-Cable

Two offline modes let you hear what the denoiser does before setting up any routing:

```powershell
# Record 10 seconds from your mic (48 kHz mono WAV):
.\noisegate.exe --record 10 raw.wav

# Run it through the denoiser:
.\noisegate.exe --denoise raw.wav clean.wav

# ...or with an ONNX model, capping suppression at 12 dB:
.\noisegate.exe --denoise raw.wav clean.wav --model model.onnx --atten 12
```

`--denoise` reports the noise floor and the speech level separately, because whole-file loudness barely moves even when all the noise is gone:

```
noise_floor="-58.1 -> -106.0 dB (-47.9)" speech="-21.9 -> -23.4 dB (-1.6)" rtf="0.003"
```

## Cargo features

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `rnnoise` | ✅ on | RNNoise backend via `nnnoiseless`. Pure-Rust, model embedded, no extra runtime deps. |
| `onnx` | off | Adds ONNX Runtime as a dependency so you can load a streaming noise-suppression ONNX model (e.g. DFN3). Needs `onnxruntime.dll` **next to `noisegate.exe`**, or `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` pointing at it — we don't let the OS search PATH and the working directory for it. |

The loader expects a **streaming** export: one frame of raw audio in, one frame out, with the recurrent state handed back on every call (`input_frame` / `states` / `atten_lim_db` in; enhanced audio + new states out). Tensor names are matched loosely and the state width is read from the model, so most DeepFilterNet3 stream exports load with no code change. Encoder/decoder-split exports, and models wanting a spectrum rather than raw audio, need their own front-end and won't load.

Build with the ONNX backend in addition to RNNoise:

```powershell
cargo build --release -p noisegate -F onnx
```

To get DeepFilterNet3 quality:
1. Build with `-F onnx`.
2. Download the DFN3 ONNX export from Hugging Face: <https://huggingface.co/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet3>.
3. Drop `onnxruntime.dll` next to `noisegate.exe` (download from <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases> — pick the `win-x64` zip). It must sit beside the exe: NoiseGate loads it by absolute path rather than searching PATH.
4. Point `model_path` in `config.toml` at the ONNX file.

Confirm it loads and actually suppresses before touching any audio routing:

```powershell
.\noisegate.exe --denoise noisy.wav clean.wav --model .\model.onnx
```

Pick an ONNX Runtime whose API version matches the `ort` crate this is pinned to — `ort` 2.0.0-rc.10 wants ONNX Runtime **1.22.x**.

## License

Code: dual MIT / Apache-2.0 — your choice.

The bundled RNNoise model (via `nnnoiseless`) is BSD-licensed — fine for any use including commercial. If you opt into the ONNX backend with DeepFilterNet3 weights, those are research / non-commercial; for commercial use, retrain on your own data or pick a different ONNX model.

## Cost

$0 for personal use. Every component is free. No driver-signing certs required (we don't ship a driver — VB-Cable does).

## Not included (yet)

- macOS / Linux backends (the audio-io crate is Windows-only; the rest is portable).
- Far-end denoising (cleaning the audio you *hear* from the call — only your mic is cleaned).
- Acoustic echo cancellation (combine with an AEC frontend if needed).
- Auto-update.
