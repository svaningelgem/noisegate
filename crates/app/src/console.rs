//! Console attachment for a GUI-subsystem binary.
//!
//! NoiseGate is built as `windows_subsystem = "windows"` so double-clicking it
//! goes straight to the tray without a console window hanging around behind
//! it. The cost is that the CLI modes (`--list-devices`, `--denoise`, …) would
//! print into the void: a GUI-subsystem process starts with no console and
//! invalid standard handles.
//!
//! [`attach_to_parent`] borrows the console of whatever launched us — the
//! PowerShell window you typed into — so command-line output still works.
//! Nothing is created when there's no parent console (a double-click), which
//! is exactly the "no console flash" behaviour we want.
