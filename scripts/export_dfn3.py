"""Convert DeepFilterNet3's published weights into the model NoiseGate runs.

    uv run scripts/export_dfn3.py [OUTPUT_DIR]

That is the whole thing. uv installs the dependencies into a throwaway
environment, the script downloads the official checkpoint, and it writes a
`DeepFilterNet3_onnx.tar.gz` that `noisegate --model <that file>` loads
directly. Nothing needs to be installed first except uv, and nothing is left
behind on your system.

Two pins are load-bearing, so leave them alone unless you are testing an
upgrade:

* **Python < 3.12** — DeepFilterLib, the packaged Rust front-end that does the
  STFT and ERB banding, publishes wheels only up to cp311. uv fetches a
  suitable interpreter itself if you do not have one.
* **torch/torchaudio < 2.2** — `deepfilternet` 0.5.6 imports
  `torchaudio.backend.common.AudioMetaData`, which later torchaudio moved and
  then deleted. Newer versions fail at import with `No module named
  'torchaudio.backend'`.

## What comes out

Three graphs plus a config, tarred together:

    enc.onnx       features      -> embedding + skip connections
    erb_dec.onnx   embedding     -> ERB gain mask
    df_dec.onnx    embedding     -> deep-filter coefficients

Upstream splits it this way on purpose: the STFT front-end belongs in the host
application, not the graph. NoiseGate runs these through DeepFilterNet's own
tract runner, which streams them correctly — see docs/model-pipeline.md for
why running them frame-at-a-time under ONNX Runtime silently destroys ~6 dB of
the near voice.

Two of the three graphs come out byte-identical to upstream's own release,
which is the evidence that this conversion is faithful rather than merely
plausible.
